Hi! My name is Rob van Bekkum. I am a software developer with a broad interest.
I obtained my BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2015 at [Delft University of Technology](http://tudelft.nl/).
A few years later, in 2017, I obtained a MSc degree in Computer Science in the Algorithmics group after presenting my [thesis](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:37e80be9-ab78-427b-b317-c5529a752d7d) about automating the development of probabilistic models for planning under uncertainty.

<p>Software Developer</p>

<p>At WSB Solutions B.V., I work as ERP Software Developer, developing add-ins, extensions and customizations for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, formerly known as Microsoft Dynamics NAV or Navision. Development happens in the database-specific languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/AL">C/AL</a> (in dedicated development environment, known as C/SIDE) and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-reference-overview">AL</a> (within <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>).

I am also one of the main developers of <a href="http://www.document-creator.com/">Document Creator</a>, an intuitive reporting solution for reports in Dynamics 365 Business Central. My work for this project includes development of the Business Central extension/NAV application-side, and .NET development of the <a href="https://www.fast-report.com/en/product/fast-report-net/">FastReport.NET</a>-based report engine, report designer, and Classic Report converter and RDLC Layout converter.</p>

<p>Software Engineer</p>

<p>In a team of three students I worked on the development of the software and firmware for the SWYCS IoT gateway. This IoT gateway has been developed to be used in combination with the SWYCS energy-management solutions. The development of the software system has been carried out in the C and C++ programming languages. The SWYCS IoT gateway allows for control of the devices that are connected to the gateway through the <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/">ZigBee</a> protocol. Customers can use it in their company to get an overview of and to manage the energy consumption of individual devices. The project was carried out as final Bachelor project and continued in the summer. More information about the project can be found in our <a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A352afb84-8714-4d23-804e-646e1a1b8c89/">thesis report</a> and on the <a href="http://www.swycs.com/">SWYCS website</a>.</p>
