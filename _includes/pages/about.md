# About

Hi! My name is Rob van Bekkum. I am a software developer with a broad interest.
I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2015 at [Delft University of Technology](http://tudelft.nl/).
Currently I am attending the Software Technology track of the Computer Science Master Programme at the same university.
My interests particularly are in the fields of software engineering and algorithmics.

<p>Software Developer</p>

<p>At WSB Solutions I work on the development of NAV objects, mainly report objects, in the development environment of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/erp-nav-overview.aspx">Microsoft Dynamics NAV</a>. These objects are defined in C/AL, a database-specific programming language to retrieve, insert, modify and remove records from the relational SQL-based database connected to NAV. Further, I work on designing custom report layouts in <a href="http://www.idyn.nl/products/nav-development/document-creator">Document Creator</a>.</p>

</strong>
<p>Software Engineer</p>

<p>In a team of three students I worked on the development of the software and firmware for the SWYCS IoT gateway. This IoT gateway has been developed to be used in combination with the SWYCS energy-management solutions. The development of the software system has been carried out in the C and C++ programming languages. The SWYCS IoT gateway allows for control of the devices that are connected to the gateway through the <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/">ZigBee</a> protocol. Customers can use it in their company to get an overview of and to manage the energy consumption of individual devices. The project was carried out as final Bachelor project and continued in the summer. More information about the project can be found in our <a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A352afb84-8714-4d23-804e-646e1a1b8c89/">thesis report</a> and on the <a href="http://www.swycs.com/">SWYCS website</a>.</p>
