Back in the study year 2014/2015, as a team of five students, we have built the cocktail robot "James" for the Minor Robotics at the Delft University of Technology.
Through an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.groepje4.cocktailapp&hl=en) you can make a selection and place your order using NFC, after which the robot gathers the ingredients and mixes the cocktail for you.
