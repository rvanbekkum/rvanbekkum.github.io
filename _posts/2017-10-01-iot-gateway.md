Back in 2015, in a group of three, we developed a software system for a second generation [SWYCS](https://www.swycs.com/) IoT Gateway.
The gateway allows one to manage and get an overview of the energy consumption of devices connected to the gateway via the ZigBee protocol.
This includes devices such as thermostats, wireless switches, shutters and coloured LED lights, which can be controlled wirelessly by their end-users.

A report summarizing the project can be found [here](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%253A352afb84-8714-4d23-804e-646e1a1b8c89).
