A VSCode extension to keep XLIFF translation files in sync with a specified, automatically generated base-XLIFF file.

This project originated from the need for a tool to automatically merge/synchronize XLIFF translation files. This extension is based on the [Angular Localization Helper](https://github.com/manux54/vsc-angular-localization-helper) developed by [manux54](https://github.com/manux54), which has been extended with various new features, fixes and enhancements. It is specifically targeted at synchronizing trans-units from a ".g.xlf" file automatically generated by the [AL Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al) extension that can be used to develop extensions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Apart from synchronizing trans-units from a base-XLIFF file, this extension contributes various other features, including:

* [Creating new target files](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync#create-new-target-files).
  * For RFC 4646 (`.xlf`) or RFC 5646 (`.xlf2`) language tags.
  * A single file, or multiple files at once:

* [Checking for missing translations](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync#check-for-missing-translations).
  * Manually, via the command `XLIFF: Check for Missing Translations`.
  * Automatically, after syncing translations (i.e., `xliffSync.autoCheckMissingTranslations`).
  * Convenient option to open XLIFF files in your default, external XLIFF editor:
    ![Informational Message on Missing Translations](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync/blob/master/resources/xliffSync_checkMissingTranslations.png?raw=true)
* [Detecting problems in translations](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync#check-for-need-work-translations).
  * Manually, via the command `XLIFF: Check for Need Work Translations`.
  * Automatically, after syncing translations (i.e., `xliffSync.autoCheckNeedWorkTranslations`).
  * Customize which rules should be used (i.e., `xliffSync.needWorkTranslationRules`).
  * Detected problems are described in an `XLIFF Sync`-note that is added to the trans-unit XML node of the translation.
  * Convenient option to open XLIFF files in your default, external XLIFF editor:
    ![Informational Message on Translations with Problems](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync/blob/master/resources/xliffSync_checkNeedWorkTranslations.png?raw=true)
* [Import translations from external XLIFF files](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync#import-translations-from-files).
  * Import from one or more `.xlf` or `.xlf2` files.
  * Merge based on "source" text and Developer Note.
  * Respect or overwrite existing translations (i.e., `xliffSync.replaceTranslationsDuringImport`).
* [Various settings for customization](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync#settings).
  * Customize [how syncing is performed](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync#usage).
  * Set what to do with line endings (i.e., `xliffSync.ignoreLineEndingTypeChanges`).
  * Set decorations for missing translations in VSCode (i.e., `xliffSync.decoration`)
* Snippets for development.
  * Parse translations from the Developer Note (i.e., `xliffSync.parseFromDeveloperNote`)
  * Use snippets during development (i.e., `xliffSync.enableSnippetsForLanguages`)
